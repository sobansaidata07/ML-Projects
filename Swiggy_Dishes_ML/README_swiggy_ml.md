# Swiggy Dish Price Prediction

This project predicts food dish prices on Swiggy using a Random Forest Regression model. The goal is to understand how factors like dish category, restaurant, location, and ratings influence pricing.

### What was done:
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
- Preprocessed categorical and numerical features using appropriate encoding techniques.
- Trained a Random Forest Regression model with hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluated model performance with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² score.

### Model Performance:
- **Training RMSE:** ₹72 
- **Training R²:** 0.89  
- **Test RMSE:** ₹119  
- **Test R²:** 0.69

The RMSE values indicate that on average, the model's predictions are off by about ₹72 on training data and ₹119 on test data, which is reasonable given the overall price ranges.
